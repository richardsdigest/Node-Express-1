# Broken App Issues
Missing Body Parser Middleware: The script doesn't use middleware to parse the JSON body of the request, which is necessary for Express to handle JSON inputs properly.

Improper Asynchronous Handling: The mapping of axios.get requests is asynchronous but is not handled correctly. The use of await inside map does not actually await the responses before proceeding.

Error Handling: The catch block references err, which is not defined, leading to a potential reference error during error handling.
